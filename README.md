# Google-Interview  
Done in Python  
A sample interview code example    
You are given an integer X.   
You must choose two adjacent digits and replace them with a single digit that equals to the rounded-up average of these two digits.   
For example, from the integer X = 623315, you can obtain:   
• 43315 (by replacing 62 with 4);   
• 63315 (by replacing 23 with 3, since the average of 2 and 3 is 2.5 that is rounded-up to 3);   
• 62315 (by replacing 33 with 3);   
• 62325 (by replacing 31 with 2);   
• 62333 (by replacing 15 with 3). 
You want to find the largest number that can be obtained from X by replacing two adjacent digits with the rounded-up average of the two.  
In the above example, the largest such number is 63315.
